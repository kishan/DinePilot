## 🌟 Overview

Running a restaurant is one of the toughest jobs in the world. Margins are thin, data is fragmented, and decisions are often made too late. DinePilot changes that.

DinePilot provides a real-time performance scorecard for General Managers, directly integrated with Toast POS. It continuously tracks sales, margins, and guest satisfaction, then uses AI recommendations to suggest actions that can immediately boost profitability.

This is not just another static dashboard. It’s an adaptive, real-time cockpit that helps GMs react in the moment — not after the shift is over.
